; Spritemap format is roughly:
;     nnnn         ; Number of entries (2 bytes)
;     xxxx yy aatt ; Entry 0 (5 bytes)
;     ...          ; Entry 1...

;     n = number of entries
;     x = X offset of sprite from centre
;     y = Y offset of sprite from centre
;     a = attributes
;     t = tile number
;
; More specifically, a spritemap entry is:
;     s000000x,xxxxxxxx,yyyyyyyy,YXppPPPt,tttttttt
; Where:
;     s = size bit
;     x = X offset of sprite from centre
;     y = Y offset of sprite from centre
;     Y = Y flip
;     X = X flip
;     P = palette
